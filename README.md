# Word-count
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from a text.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Open the file in read mode and handle it in test mood.
### Step 2: 
Read the text using read() function.
### Step 3: 
Split the text using space separator.We assume that words in a sentence are separated by a space character.
### Step 4:  
The laugh of the split list should equal the numbers of words in the test file.

You can refine the count by cleaning the string prior to splitting or validating the words after splitting.
